# Fastr

## Project Postmortem

This project has been archived. It's codebase it hard to work with and has not been actively worked for 6 months. The most recent changes to Fastr are in the IMD repository, and a replacement for Fastr may come in the future. Fastr didn't really live up to it's goals â€“ it certainly wasn't bloatware-free or lightweight, and it had horrible api for creating commands. Features like `*` and `+` were pretty broken and the whole architecture was flawed. It is not reccomended to use Fastr in new work.

Fastr is a bloat ware free, lightweight, highly configurable roblox admin system designed to be easy to use.

### With Roblox

download either of these models and add them to your roblox game. (note: the loader version does not include the source code of Fastr, instead it requires Fastr (it can be configured to require the stable, unstable and experimental versions of Fastr). The Source version comes with all of Fastr's source code, which means you can modify it to your liking, but it won't automatically update.)
