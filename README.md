### With Roblox

download either of these models and add them to your roblox game. (note: the loader version does not include the source code of Fastr, instead it requires Fastr (it can be configured to require the stable, unstable and experimental versions of Fastr). The Source version comes with all of Fastr's source code, which means you can modify it to your liking, but it won't automatically update.)
